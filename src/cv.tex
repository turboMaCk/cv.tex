\section{Introduction}

\begin{tabular}{@{}l@{\hskip 20pt}r}
    \begin{minipage}[l]{0.58\textwidth}
      I'm web developer with near 10 years professional experience
      with web development and design, and even longer programming backgound.
      During my carrer I've worked on design, architecture and implementation
      of various sucessfull and less sucessfull projects and had an oportunity
      to lead teams and influence processes and technlogy choices.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      While my background is not academical, over time I build high appreciation for
      theoretical parts of computer science and was able to utilize traditionaly
      academic ideas in practice. In particular I've build intereseted in
      statically typed pure functional programming, language theory and type theory.

      \vspace{0.5em}
      For past over 4 years I've lead fully distributed team of developers applying
      purely functional programming to build user interface application used by thousands
      of custommers around the world.
